## Part 1

### Discription:

![Image](pictures\labReport4\searchForStart.JPG)

- This image shows me finding the first iteration of `start` by entering `/start` then `<enter>`.
- I then type in `c` `g` `n` to delete and change the word that I looked for and save the pattern that I replaced it with.
- In this case, I will replace it by typing the pattern: `base`

- After clicking `<esc>` to exit out of INSERT mode, I simply type in `n` and then `.` to replace the next iteration of the word I looked for, in this case `start`, with the previous saved pattern , in this case `base`.
- I then click `<esc>` to get out of INSERT mode to do this again for the other iterations.

- I once again type `n` and `.` to replace the orginal word with `base` and then `<esc>` to exit INSERT mode to do it one last time.
